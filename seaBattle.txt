The question is based on this idea :

if we have m containers and in some container there is ball, how many containers do we need to turn over to find out the ball, it's n
what about if there are two balls, it would be n-1 (think)

if there are m balls, it would be n - (m-1)

now as the ship will be destroyed by any point of it's length, the only thing that matters is the positions of these ships possible loacations (containers)
